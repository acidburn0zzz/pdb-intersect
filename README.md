# pdb-intersect
Find common peering points in peeringdb.

This is a brother to https://github.com/rucarrol/PeerFinder

It will find common possible peering points, even if either of the
peering parties is NOT using the same ASN in all locations (like, incidentally, 3557 does).

## Installation

  - throw the files in your bin directory
  - edit the config file to put your pdb credentials in
  - make sure the config file is protected
